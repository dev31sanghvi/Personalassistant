# Personalassistant

This is a simple personal assistant program implemented in C++. It allows users to interact with their computer by giving commands and performing various tasks. 

Usage
Upon running the program, the user is prompted to enter a password for verification.
If the password is correct, the program greets the user based on the time of day (Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening).
The user can then enter commands to perform specific tasks.
Available commands include greetings ("hello" or "hi"), retrieving the current time and date, opening applications, launching websites, closing the Chrome browser, opening images and documents, playing videos, and exiting the program ("bye" or "exit").
If the password is incorrect, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to re-enter the password.
